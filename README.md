Happy Birthday Christian, 2011
==============================

A micro site created in 2011 to wish Christian Rodriguez a happy birthday. If it is the day of
Christian's birthday (in server time) then a "mad lib" style game is displayed, along with a
picture of the man himself. Otherwise a countdown page is shown.

The site is written in [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.org) and uses the jQuery Countdown script
[written by Keith Wood](http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html).

This site was originally hosted at http://celebrate.christians.birthdaywith.us,
a domain that was purchased and used only for this purpose.
